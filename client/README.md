## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:
```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'cloudmersive-voice-recognition-api-client'

# Setup authorization
CloudmersiveVoiceRecognitionApiClient.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: Apikey
  config.api_key['Apikey'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  #config.api_key_prefix['Apikey'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = CloudmersiveVoiceRecognitionApiClient::RecognizeApi.new

speech_file = File.new("/path/to/file.txt") # File | Speech file to perform the operation on.  Common file formats such as WAV, MP3 are supported.


begin
  #Recognize audio input as text using machine learning
  result = api_instance.recognize_file(speech_file)
  p result
rescue CloudmersiveVoiceRecognitionApiClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling RecognizeApi->recognize_file: #{e}"
end

```
